# ThisIsNotRealGame
***This is an underdeveloped and unfinished project I used to learn about Unity.***

After entering the "island" scene you can switch weapons by scrolling the mouse wheel. You can also toss a teleporter by pressing Q
and you can teleport to it's position by pressing E. If you hold F you can modify gravity in order to jump higher, fall slower, or glide for long distances.
The menu doesn't really do much since the save system was never introduced, you can still restart the level using the pause menu though.
The sniper rifle is currently the only weapon that can kill the defence drones, they are unaffected by the laser and the shockprod.
The laser and shockprod will work on the worker droids though.

This project is on hiatus at the moment, while I try to figure out what to do with it.
